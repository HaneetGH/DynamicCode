# AndroidDynamicCodeExample

1- On Opening the app system will download .dex file from server ( I have chosen my own hosting server as google drive was making some security issue)
2- System will Copy that .dex into phone's memory and execute it.

Note:-System isn't designed to do some fancy stuff but system will print some value in console.


Happy Coding.....
